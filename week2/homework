2. Research how to create multiple nested directories with one mkdir command.
E.g. How would you create 'fun' directory along with all directories in the path below:
/c/Users/unmesh/these/folders/are/just/for/fun
answer: we use mkdir -p newfolder/newfolder1/newfolder2/newfolder3 endter.
3: Execute following commands terminal:
echo "test" > fun
echo "another test" >> fun
wc -c fun
Verify number of characters in the file.
anwser:characters become 18
4: Research how to append something in the file *WITHOUT* a newline character.
E.g.
echo "test" > fun
echo "another test" >> fun
cat fun
Output of "cat fun" is
test
another test

How would you use echo command, so that output would be:
testanother test
4: 
Output of "cat fun" is
test
another test
echo "test"; echo "another test"
anwser: test
       another test
