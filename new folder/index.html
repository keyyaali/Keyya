 <p class="firstexperience">Its my first blog ever , I wrote dairy some time but never tried to write blog.
 This is 17 July of 2015. I just arrived in Amsterdam airport. actually I don’t know where to say I came here for asylum . I was setting in my set and thinking about it. Everyone is going out from aircraft. Then I decided to go to immigration desk to say them I came here for asylum . when I come out from Airplane there were three immigration officer were checking the passport and they checked my passport and the stopped me.  Then the checking was over the officer ask me where are you going ? I said “in Amsterdam” . then he ask me “why you came to Amsterdam” ? I replied him “just for a tour”.
 I was so afraid. I want to tell him that why I came here but I cant . then he say to me “you can go please” . I was the last one who is going . everyone went already. Now I’m going together with the immigration officers to the immigration desk . I ask one of them I came here for asylum where should I ask for asylum . the lady immigration officer replied me” welcome to our land, you are in right time, right place and with right person, give me your passport and follow me”.

        <p class="lifeamsterdam"> Amsterdammers come out as among the happiest people in the world. It’s a clean and safe city, where your mode of transport doubles as exercise (goodbye, gym) and there are beautiful parks and green spaces to recharge in. Even if you only pedal around for a few hours, riding a bike is an essential Amsterdam experience. Renting a bike or taking a guided cycle tour is a great way to discover the city and can be quite an adventure.</p>
